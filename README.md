# Bouncing-Ball

Inspired by "The Coding Train's Bouncing Ball Processing Tutorial" (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIKRXl3wH8Y), I have created my own version of it.

In this program, the ball moves in 2D, it's speed changes periodically, the background color changes depending on the speed, and I also added a kind of elasticity-effect for the ball just for fun.

Have fun running it on Processing!
